# Git Commit States

Git tracks files in three main states: **Untracked**, **Staged**, and **Committed**.

## 1. Untracked State  
A file is **untracked** when it exists in the working directory but has not been added to Git. This means Git does not track any changes made to the file.
## 2. Staged	
The file is added to the staging area and ready to be committed.
## 3. Committed	
The file is saved permanently in the repository.

### ðŸ”¹ **Reverting to Previous Versions**
- If an update breaks the application, you can roll back to a stable version using:
